          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Today It came to my attention that the quest fot obtaining a toothbrush was still in my (I'll do this later)quest-list.
            And with Eva's yearly trip to the Tower alost at it's end, I had to get moving for this particulary quest was given to me by Eva and the Triumpf where you have
             to Slay 75 Nightmare Bosses seemed more time consuming. This normaly wouln'd be a problem but my alter ego's PS fun time has been drasticly cut in half .</p>
            <p>So there I was standing on the Moon, trying to remeber who I last saw in Obtaining this Toothbrush. I rememberd It all started on the moon where Eris gave me a box of raisins,
            They led me to the tangeld Shore where Spidy traded me the box of raisins for a Winged Chew but only after Killing some pesky little Skorn,Cabal and Hive. So I did that and
          I suddenly rememberd Ana really likes Winged Chew so I went to Mars and she to had some killing request before trading them for some unchocolade. Of to Io I went to speak to Asher
        and of course more killing, I was getting a bit tired of all the Killling so I thought to myself "you know warlock Renee, you really deserve a spa day, get all of that blood of your
        face espesially the cooked up shit behind your ears" but first more killing! But the only thing I got in Return from Asher was a fucking piece of Celery....Basterd.
      Completly forgetting about my spa day I was on my way to Brother Vance on Mercury who gave me some splice Drops after accuiring some more blood behind my ears, I think I got
    some in my boots as well. And OOOOHh my goodness I still had no toothbrush, no no, on Nessus maby? OF COURSE NOT... friggin Failsave gave me some fucking Salted sweets and send me on my
  way to Devrim</p>
